<h3>Project Description</h3><br/><br/>

The goal of this project is to compute the inverse Laplace transform of the function
<br/>
F(s) = 1/sqrt(s^3+m) 
<br/> 
where m is the first digit of your SUID. 
The methods of MAT 514 do not work here, and WolframAlpha cannot help either. 
Instead, we can use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%27s_inversion_formula">Post's inversion formula</a>
which gives f(t) as a limit of a certain expression with k<sup>th</sup> derivative of F, as k tends to infinity. In theory, choosing a larger
value of k will produce a better approximation to the inverse transform. In practice, increasing k may lead to loss of precision.
You should find the right balance (a suitable value of k) by trial and error. 
<br/><br/>
For this project I recommend using <strong>Sage</strong>,  powerful open-source mathematics software. 
To run it in a browser, follow this link: <a href="http://www.sagenb.org/">Sage Notebook</a> and create an account. 
Sage can be also downloaded from sagemath.org and installed locally, but this is not as easy.

<h3>Technical Details</h3><br/><br/>
Here is a possible Sage input, with comments in italic: 
<br/><br/>
s,t = var('s t')  <br/> <em>declares variables s and t</em>
<br/><br/>
F(s) = 1/sqrt(s^3+1) <br/><em>use your value of m instead of 1</em>
<br/><br/>
k = 1 <br/><em>you will need a larger value of k to get a reasonable approximation</em>
<br/><br/>
dF = F.diff(k) <br/><em>computes the k<sup>th</sup> derivative of F</em>
<br/><br/>
f(t) = (-1)^k/factorial(k)*(k/t)^(k+1)*dF(k/t) <br/><em>Post's inversion formula</em>
<br/><br/>
plot(f,0,10) <br/><em>plots the approximate inverse on [0,10]</em>

The result of your investigation should be submitted as a screenshot via Blackboard. 
You should also comment on your choice of k in the text area Comments. 
<strong>The project is due at 10PM on Friday, November 18.</strong>
<br/><br/>  
Notes: <br/> (1) Press Shift-Enter to evaluate a Sage command or group of commands. 
<br/> (2) You can Interrupt and/or Restart a notebook in case of technical difficulties.
<br/> (3) Sage is written in Python, so you can use Python syntax such as "for k in range(a,b):" to jazz things up.
