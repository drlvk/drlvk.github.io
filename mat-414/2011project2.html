<h3>Project Description</h3><br/><br/>

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of three numerical methods of solving differential equations:
<strong>Euler</strong> method, <strong>Modified Euler</strong>, and <strong>Runge-Kutta (RK4)</strong>.
<br/></br>
Consider the initial value problem 
<br/><br/>
<strong>y'=m*cos(m*x)*y, with y(0)=k</strong>
<br/><br/>
Here m is 10+(1st digit of your SUID), k=2+(2nd digit of your SUID). 
<br/><br/>
 <h3>Your goal</h3><br/> 
is to find the exact solution of this IVP and, most importantly, compare it to the numerical approximations.
The comparison should be made on the <strong>interval 0&le;x&le;5</strong>. 
<br/><br/>
For each of three methods find a <em>critical step size</em> h such that the numerical solution is an 
acceptable approximation when step size is h, but is not acceptable if step size is 10*h. 
Use your judgment to decide what is an acceptable approximation. 
<br/><br/>

The results of this investigation will consist of 6 screenshots: Euler with critical step size, 
Euler with 10*(critical step size), and so on. These should be combined into one file using software 
such as Microsoft Word (or its free alternative, OpenOffice Writer), and accompanied by a paragraph with 
your comparison of three methods. The file should be submitted via 
<a href="http://blackboard.syr.edu/" target="_blank">Blackboard</a> 
by 10PM on Monday, October 3.

<h3>Technical Details</h3><br/><br/>

For this project I recommend using the applet 
<a href="http://alamos.math.arizona.edu/~rychlik/JOde/JOdeVerifier.html" target="_blank">Solution Verifier</a> 
although you are free to use your favorite math software package instead. 
<br/><br/>
<h3>How to use the applet</h3> 

<p>"eqn #1 dy/dx=" is m*cos(m*x)*y with m as above</p>
<p>"Function #1: y=" is the solution you found yourself. This will be plotted in green color.
The numerical approximation will appear in black.</p>
<p>Choose the window Min&nbsp;x =0, Max&nbsp;x =5, Min&nbsp;y =0. For Max&nbsp;y enter the number 3*k where k is as above</p>
<p>Ignore "Num of segs": this line refers to the slope field which we don't need here.</p>
<p>In the line "Show", uncheck "Slopes" to get rid of the slope field. </p>
<p>"Add init. cond.:" enter x=0, y=k. </p>
<p>The applet has two Submit buttons: one for equation and one for initial value. </p>
<p>Use Clear All to remove plots that are not needed.</p>
<p>Avoid moving the mouse pointer over the graphing window, because this changes the initical 
conditions.</p>
