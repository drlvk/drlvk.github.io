<p>(Theoretical) The SIR model assumes that any two individuals are equally likely to “mix”, i.e., to meet and potentially transmit the disease. Modify the model to account for different groups within a population (for example, on-campus and off-campus students).  This means having two groups of susceptible individuals: \(S_1\) and \(S_2\text{,}\) and two groups of infected ones: \(I_1\) and \(I_2\text{.}\) The recovered/removed ones can be all in one group \(R\) since their interactions do not matter. Since there should be more interaction within each group than between the two groups, the products \(S_1I_1\) and \(S_2I_2\) should have larger coefficients in the system than \(S_1I_2\) and \(S_2I_1\text{.}\)</p>
