<p>In terms of probability theory, the random choice of \(x\) makes \(f(x)\) a <dfn class="terminology">random variable</dfn>. This random variable has <dfn class="terminology">mean value</dfn> \(\mu\) equal to the average of \(f\) over \(D\text{.}\) Its <dfn class="terminology">variance</dfn> \(\sigma^2\) is the average of \((f-\mu)^2\) over \(D\text{.}\) The Central Limit Theorem tells us that the mean of \(N\) independent samples is approximately normally distributed with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^2 / N\text{.}\)  In particular, with probability about \(99.7\%\) the sample mean is within three standard deviations of the mean, which means the error of Monte-Carlo method is very likely to be bounded by \(3\sigma /\sqrt{N}\text{.}\) On one hand, this tends to zero quite slowly. On another hand, the rate at which it tends to zero is independent of dimension \(d\text{.}\)</p>
