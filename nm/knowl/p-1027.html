<p>We focus on the case of two categories, represented by the binary outcome variable \(z\) attaining two possible values, \(0\) and \(1\text{.}\) The model may involve one or more explanatory variables \(x_k\text{,}\) and the goal is to predict the outcome based on these variables. Some examples:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Explanatory variables: temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure. Outcome: rain (1) or no rain (0).</li>
<li>Explanatory variables: patient's weight, height, age, activity level. Outcome: has diabetes (1) or not (0).</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">In the examples such as these, it is understood that the prediction may be far from certain. A way to think of such a model as assigning a probability of outcome (1), based on the data available. This leads to the idea of a model being a function that takes values between \(0\) and \(1\text{.}\) The standard logistic function (<a href="section-using-fminsearch-curvefit.html" class="internal" title="Section 29.2: Using fminsearch for curve-fitting">SectionÂ 29.2</a>) has this property:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">In order to include several explanatory variables \(x_1, \dots, x_m\) in this model, we use the composite function</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
h_{\mathbf c}(\mathbf x) = \sigma\left(\sum_{k=1}^m c_k x_k\right) = \frac{1}{1+\exp\left(-\sum_{k=1}^m c_k x_k\right)}\tag{36.1.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where the coefficients \(c_1, \dots, c_m\) are to be determined by training the model on some data set with known outcomes.</p>
