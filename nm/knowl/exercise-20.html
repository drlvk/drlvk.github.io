<p>Write a script that solves the equation \(e^x + \log x = n\) using the fixed point iteration. Here \(n\) is the number formed by the first two digits of your SUID.</p>
<p>In order to use the fixed point method, you need to rewrite the given equation as \(g(x) = x\text{.}\)  There are several ways to do this, try at least two different ones, or as many as are needed until a root is found. Starting from some value of \(x\text{,}\) such as \(x=10\text{,}\) below, run fixed point iteration until either it converges to a root, or the number of iterations becomes extremely large. The script should display either “Root found at x = ... after ... steps” or “Failed to converge”. Add a comment with the different functions \(g\) you tried, and what the outcome was.</p>
<p>Here, as in in Matlab and in most mathematical texts, \(\log\) means the natural logarithm, base \(e\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-fixed-point-iteration.html#exercise-20">in-context</a></span>
