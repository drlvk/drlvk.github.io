<p>Back in the days when Matlab was designed, the convention was to put every named function in a separate “M-file” named as that function: for example, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">goldenratio.m</code>. Modern versions allow multiple named functions appear in the same file, along with code using those functions. However, one arbitrary restriction remains: “Function definitions in a script must appear at the end of the file.” For example, the following is allowed:<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">x = 0.3;
y = 12;
disp(agm(x, y, 1e-6))

function z = agm(x, y, tol) 
   while abs(x - y) &gt;= tol
       a = (x + y)/2;
       g = sqrt(x*y);
       x = a;
       y = g;
   end
   z = x;
end
</pre>but moving the first three lines (top-level code) after the named function would result in an error.</p>
