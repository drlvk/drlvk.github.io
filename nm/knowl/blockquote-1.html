<p>Suppose for instance that you are both a mathematician and an industrialist, and want to transfer a huge amount of coal from your mines to your factories. You can hire trucks to do this transportation problem, but you have to pay them \(c(X, Y)\) for each ton of coal which is transported from place \(X\) to place \(Y\text{.}\) Both the amount of coal which you can extract from each mine, and the amount which each factory should receive, are fixed. As you are trying to […] minimize the price you have to pay, another mathematician comes to you and tells you:</p>
<p>“My friend, let me handle this for you: I will ship all your coal with my own trucks and you won't have to worry about what goes where. I will just set a price \(\varphi(X)\) for loading one ton of coal at place \(X\text{,}\) and a price \(\psi(Y)\) for unloading it at destination \(Y\text{.}\) I will set the prices in such a way that your financial interest will be to let me handle all your transportation! Indeed, you can check very easily that for any \(X\) and \(Y\text{,}\) the sum \(\varphi(X)+\psi(Y)\) will always be \(\le c(X, Y)\) (in order to achieve this goal, I am even ready to give financial compensations for some places, in the form of negative prices!)”.</p>
<p>Of course you accept the deal. Now, what Kantorovich's duality tells you is that if this shipper is clever enough, then he can arrange the prices in such a way that you will pay […] as much as you would have been ready to spend by the other method.</p>
