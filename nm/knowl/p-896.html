<p>Suppose we arrived to point \(\mathbf a\) from point \(\mathbf b\text{,}\) following the direction vector \(\mathbf v\text{.}\) With the conjugate gradient method, the direction of our next move will be\(\mathbf w = -\nabla f(a) + \gamma \mathbf v\) where \(\gamma &gt; 0\text{.}\) Large \(\gamma\) means we keep mostly the same direction as before, small \(\gamma\) means we go with the gradient. We should make \(\gamma\) smaller, giving more importance to the gradient, if \(\mathbf a\) is much closer to the minimum than \(\mathbf b\text{.}\) This progress can be measured by the ratio \(|\nabla f(\mathbf a)|^2/|\nabla f(\mathbf b)|^2\) (small if we arrived in the vicinity of minimum), so we use this quantity as \(\gamma\text{.}\)</p>
