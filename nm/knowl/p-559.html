<p>Since the Gauss integration rule is the most accurate of those we discussed, one may decide to use it for both \(I_1\) and \(I_2\text{,}\) just with different number of evaluation points, perhaps \(n\) and \(2n\text{.}\) A downside is that Gauss evaluation points are not nested. In practice, the Gauss rule is used for \(I_1\) and the Kronrod rule (also based on orthogonal polynomials, but beyond our scope) is used for \(I_2\text{.}\) The Kronrod rule is designed to include all of the points used by the Gauss rule, and some additional ones. A popular choice, e.g., in TI graphing calculators, is (G7, K15), meaning 7-point Gauss rule combined with 15-point Kronrod rule. For an illustration of adaptive integration in Python module SciPy, see <a class="external" href="https://calculus7.wordpress.com/2018/10/27/numerical-integration-visualized/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>: it shows that SciPy uses (G10, K21) combination.</p>
