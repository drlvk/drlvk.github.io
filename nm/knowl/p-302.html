<p>In order to use the fixed point method, you need to rewrite the given equation as \(g(x) = x\text{.}\)  There are several ways to do this, try at least two different ones, or as many as are needed until a root is found. Starting from some value of \(x\text{,}\) such as \(x=10\text{,}\) below, run fixed point iteration until either it converges to a root, or the number of iterations becomes extremely large. The script should display either “Root found at x = ... after ... steps” or “Failed to converge”. When submitting homework on Blackboard, add a comment with the different functions \(g\) you tried, and what the outcome was.</p>
