<p>The <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Encoding" target="_blank">JPEG compression algorithm</a> is based on the Fourier Transform but differs from the above example in several ways:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>It divides the image into 8<span class="times-sign">Ã—</span>8 pixel blocks and operates on each block separately.</li>
<li>It uses Discrete Cosine Transform in which the role of complex exponentials \(\exp(2\pi i k/m)\) is played by cosine functions \(\cos(2\pi k/m)\text{.}\) This improves the efficiency and eliminates the appearance of complex numbers.</li>
<li>In addition to setting small Fourier coefficients to 0, it quantizes the other ones: rounds to the nearest integer, or nearest multiple of 5, etc.</li>
<li>Since setting many elements to 0 does not by itself make a matrix smaller, the final step of the process is running a lossless compression algorithm which exploits the existence of many equal entries in the matrix.</li>
</ul>
