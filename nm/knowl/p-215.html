<p>A practical use of least squares solutions is linear regression. Suppose we are given some data points \((x_k, y_k)\) and want to find the line \(y = cx+d\) that fits these points the best. The idea is to imagine we could have perfect fit:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
c x_1 + d \amp = y_1 \\
c x_2 + d \amp = y_2 \\
\cdots \amp = \cdots \\
c x_m + d \amp = y_m 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">This system can be written as \(Az=b\) where</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
A = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \amp 1 \\ x_2 \amp 1 \\ \vdots \amp \vdots \\ x_m \amp 1 \end{pmatrix},
\quad 
b = \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_m \end{pmatrix}, 
\quad z = \begin{pmatrix} c \\ d \end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">This is an overdetermined system when we have more than 2 data points. Unless all \(x\)-values are the same (which should not happen), the rank of A is 2 and so the system has no free variables. This means that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">A\b</code> will find its least squares solution: a vector with components \((c, d)\) for which the sum of squares of the residuals \(cx_k+d - y_k\) is as small as possible. This is the line of best least-squares fit, and this process is known as linear regression in statistics.</p>
