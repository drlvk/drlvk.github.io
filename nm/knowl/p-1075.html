<p>Linear programming offers a very different, geometric approach to classification. Think of observations with \(m\) explanatory variables as  points in \(\mathbb R^m\text{,}\) which are colored (say, red or blue) according to their category. Our goal is to find a plane (or surface) that separates the points of different colors as cleanly as possible.</p>
