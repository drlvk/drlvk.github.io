<p>The idea of Newton's method is geometrically natural. We want to solve \(f(x) = 0\) but since \(f\) may be complicated, we replace it by its linear approximation (tangent line at a certain point). The resulting linear equation is easy to solve. Of course, its solution is probably not a solution of the original equation, but perhaps it is close to it. The process repeats, using the previously found solution as a new point at which to draw a tangent line. A static image of this process is below. <a class="external" href="https://www.intmath.com/applications-differentiation/newtons-method-interactive.php" target="_blank">Interactive visualization</a> is also available.</p>
