<p>We need 5 linear equations involving integrals of \(x^0, x^1, \dots, x^4\text{.}\) If we number them by index \(i\) running from 1 to 5, then the equation has \(\int_{-1}^1 x^{i-1}\,dx\)  on the right hand side, which is \((1-(-1)^i)/i\text{.}\) On the left we have the sum \(\sum_j w_j x_j^{i-1}\) which means the coefficients of the unknown \(w_j\) is \(x_j^{i-1}\text{.}\) We can create a matrix using outer exponentiation of a row vector by a column vector.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">n = 5;
x = linspace(-1, 1, n);
i = (1:n)'; 
A = x.^(i-1);
b = (1-(-1).^i)./i;
w = A\b;
disp(rats(w'))
</pre>
<p>Here <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">rats</code> is used to display the solution as rational numbers (which they are) rather than the usual decimal approximation.</p>
<p>Having computed the weights as above, we can integrate any function f on [-1, 1] simply by executing <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">f(x)*w</code>, which is the dot product of a vector with function values with the vector of weights. Try this for the exponential function.</p>
