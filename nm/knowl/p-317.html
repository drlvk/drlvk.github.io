<p>The second reason the zeros of derivative are problematic is that a point where \(f(x) = f'(x) = 0\) is not a superattracting fixed point of \(g\text{,}\) even if we manage to extend the definition of \(g\) to such a point by canceling out the zero in the denominator. For example, let \(f(x) = x^p\) where \(p \gt 1\text{.}\) Clearly, \(f(0)=f'(0)=0\text{.}\) Computing</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
g(x) = \frac{xf'(x) -f(x)}{f'(x)} = \frac{px^p - x^p}{px^{p-1}} = \frac{p-1}{p}x 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">we see that \(g\) can be extended to \(g(0)=0\text{.}\) Since \(|g'(0)| = (p-1)/p \lt 1\text{,}\) this is an attracting point. But it is not a super-attracting one, which means the speed of convergence of Newton's method to such <dfn class="terminology">multiple roots</dfn> is slow: linear instead of quadratic. Here is an example of what happens with \(f(x) = x^3\text{:}\) the points approach the root \(x=0\) quite slowly, with each step being \(1/3\) of the distance to the root. This is even slower than bisection.</p>
