<p>Write a script that attempts to solve the equation \(\arctan x - 1 = 0\) using Newton's method (Note that Matlab's  notation for arctangent is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">atan</code>.) Similarly to <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-secant-method.html" title="Example 9.3.1: Implement the secant method">Example 9.3.1</a> and <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-solve-fixed-point-iteration.html" title="Example 8.2.1: Rewrite and solve by fixed-point iteration">Example 8.2.1</a>, the script should show the number of steps it took to find a solution, or report that it failed to converge. Allow the algorithm up to 10000 steps before giving up. As the initial point <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">x0</code>, use the number formed by the first two digits of your SUID. (Note: it is expected that your script will fail to converge.)</p>
<p>Introduce a relaxation parameter \(\omega\) in your script to help it converge. What value of \(\omega\) achieves convergence? Be careful: \(\omega\) should be small, but if it is too small, the algorithm will fail to converge because it takes too long.</p>
<p>When submitting homework on Blackboard, comment on what values of \(\omega\) you found to be too large for convergence, what value was too small for convergence, and what value achieved convergence.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-newton-secant.html#exercise-22">in-context</a></span>
