<body><article class="question example-like"><p>The word “bisection” means dividing something into two parts, usually equal ones. In the bisection method, an interval is divided into two equal parts, of which we keep one. This means that the length of the interval is divided by 2 at each step.</p>
<p>One can imagine a similar “trisection method” where an interval is divided into three equal parts, and one of them is kept. With this method, the length of the interval is divided by 3 at each step, so the interval shrinks faster.  Does this make the trisection method faster than the bisection method? Why or why not?</p></article></body>
