<p>“My friend, let me handle this for you: I will ship all your coal with my own trucks and you won't have to worry about what goes where. I will just set a price \(\varphi(X)\) for loading one ton of coal at place \(X\text{,}\) and a price \(\psi(Y)\) for unloading it at destination \(Y\text{.}\) I will set the prices in such a way that your financial interest will be to let me handle all your transportation! Indeed, you can check very easily that for any \(X\) and \(Y\text{,}\) the sum \(\varphi(X)+\psi(Y)\) will always be \(\le c(X, Y)\) (in order to achieve this goal, I am even ready to give financial compensations for some places, in the form of negative prices!)”.</p>
