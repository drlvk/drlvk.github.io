<p>The secant method is a close relative of Newton's method. The only difference is that instead of drawing a tangent line and finding where it crosses the line \(y=0\) we do the same for a secant line. The slope of a secant line is computed as \((f(x)-f(p))/(x-p)\) where \(x, p\) are two distinct points on the x-axis. The benefit is that we do not need the derivative of \(f\text{,}\) we only use the function itself. The drawback is that we have to keep track not of just one point, but of two. This makes the algorithm slightly more complicated: it is not just fixed-point iteration of some function \(g\) as in Newton's method. Also, the analysis of its speed of convergence is more complicated: generally, it is between linear and quadratic; faster than bisection but slower than Newton.</p>
