<p>Another nice feature of the integration rules based on orthogonal polynomials is that all weights \(w_k\) are positive (unlike in the Newton-Cotes rules, which may give negative weights to some points). To see why, consider the polynomial \(G(x) = F(x)/(x-x_k)^2\) where \(F\) is as in the previous paragraph. Since \((x-x_k)^2\) cancels out, \(G\) is a polynomial of degree \(2n-2\text{.}\) Therefore, the integration rule is exact for it:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-1}^1 G(x)\,dx = w_k G(x_k)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where the right hand side has just one term because \(G(x_j)=0\) for all indices \(j\ne k\text{.}\) Since \(G\) is a square, the left hand side is positive and \(G(x_k)\) is also positive. Hence \(w_k &gt; 0\text{.}\)</p>
