<p>How to find the weights that make the rule <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-cotes1.html" title="Equation 14.3.1">(14.3.1)</a> as accurate as possible? We can require both sides to be equal when \(f\) is each of the following: \(x^0, x^1, \dots, x^{n-1}\text{.}\) This gives \(n\) linear equations with \(n\) unknowns \(w_j\text{.}\) Then solve the system, perhaps using Matlab. The resulting rules are called Newton-Cotes rules when the points are distributed at equal intervals. They include trapezoidal rule (2 points) and Simpson's rule (3 points) as special cases.</p>
