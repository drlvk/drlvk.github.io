<p>What form of duality is this, and where do negative prices come from? This is an example of asymmetric duality, where the primal problem is of type EN (moving nonnegative amounts of coal, which must add up exactly to what is available or required), and the dual problem is of type IR (setting possibly negative prices, allowing for inequalities \(\varphi(X)+\psi(Y) \le c(X, Y)\)). Here is a concrete example with two coal mines and three factories: the amounts of production, consumption, and transportation costs per unit are stated on the diagram.</p>
