<p>This terminology needs some explanation. The word <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_spline" target="_blank">spline</a> used to refer to a long thin strip of flexible material (e.g., metal) which, if constrained at several points, assumes the shape of a smooth curve passing through these points. Unlike an elastic band which minimizes its length (creating a piecewise linear shape), the spline minimizes its <em class="emphasis">bending energy</em>. A mathematical idealization of the bending energy of a curve \(y=f(x)\) is the integral \(\int_a^b f''(x)^2\,dx\text{.}\) It can be shown that among <em class="emphasis">all functions</em> (of whatever form) that satisfy the constraints \(f(x_k)=y_k\text{,}\) the “natural spline” has the smallest value of \(\int_a^b f''(x)^2\,dx\text{.}\) This attractive mathematical property earned it the “natural” name… but upon further reflection, the boundary conditions \(S''(a) = 0 = S''(b)\) are actually not that natural. If we are interpolating some smooth function \(y=f(x)\text{,}\) there is no reason to assume that \(f''\) happens to be \(0\) at the endpoints.</p>
