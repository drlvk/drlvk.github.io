<p>We have been using <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">disp</code> command to display some number or text. But we may want to display a sentence with some numbers included in it. And we may want to show more (or fewer) digits than <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">disp</code> does. For this, the command <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">fprintf</code> is useful:  it produces an <dfn class="terminology">interpolated string</dfn> which combines text and numeric data according to some formatting codes. For example,</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">fprintf('The number pi is %.15f and its cube is %.3f\n', pi, pi^3)</pre>
<p data-braille="continuation">displays “The number pi is 3.141592653589793 and its cube is 31.006”. Explanation:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The first argument of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">fprintf</code> is a string, the other arguments are numbers which will be inserted into the string. Here the numbers are pi and pi cubed.</li>
<li>The formatting code <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">%.15f</code> says: insert a number with 15 digits after decimal point. This is the first formatting code, so it uses the first number provided after the string, which is pi.</li>
<li>The formatting code <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">%.3f</code> says: insert a number with 3 digits after decimal point. Since this is the second formatting code in the string, it will use the second of the numbers after the string, which is pi cubed.</li>
<li>The string ends with new line character <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">\n</code>, which is a good idea in general. Without it, subsequent output would appear on the same line, and would be hard to read.</li>
</ul>
