<p>We briefly encountered least-squares fit in <a href="chapter-linear-systems.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Systems of linear equations">ChapterÂ 6</a> but this method deserves a closer look in regard to how we choose a model to fit a given data set. It is one thing to find a function that matches the data (interpolation), another to have a model that learns from the data and has predictive power. Interpolation uses about as many parameters (coefficients) as the number of data points; curve-fitting uses relatively few parameters, hence does not hit the points precisely. Using too many parameters results in overfitting: a model begins to memorize training data rather than learning to generalize from trend.</p>
