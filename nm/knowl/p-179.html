<p>Back in the days when Matlab was designed, the convention was to put every function in a separate “M-file” named as that function: for example, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">goldenratio.m</code>. Today, tying the name of a function to the name of a file in which it is contained seems strange but Matlab still insists on this. Fortunately, it allows us to have multiple functions in the same script file, with the following constraints:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The first function is named as the file itself. This function gets executed when we click Run or press <kbd class="kbdkey">F5</kbd>.</li>
<li>If a script contains named functions, all of its code must be within some function.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">This means that if a script contains named functions, and is saved in a file named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">hw5.m</code>, it must begin with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">function hw5()</code>, for example:</p>
