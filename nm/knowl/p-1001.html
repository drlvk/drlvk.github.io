<p>Imagine applying force \(\mathbf c\) to the point \(\mathbf x^*\text{:}\) if it can be moved in this direction, the objective function will increase. Since such an increase is impossible, the force \(\mathbf c\) must be balanced by reaction forces of the “walls”, i.e., hyperplanes \((A\mathbf x)_k\le b_k\text{,}\) which represent constraints. Only the <em class="emphasis">active</em> constraints, those for which \((A\mathbf x^*)_k = b_k\text{,}\) are relevant here, since \(\mathbf x^*\) does not touch the hyperplanes of inactive constraints. The normal vectors of the constraint hyperplanes are given by the rows of \(A\text{.}\) Transposition makes \(\mathbf c\) a linear combination of the columns of \(A^T\) with nonnegative coefficients; moreover, the coefficients of inactive constraints are zero. This means that \(\mathbb c = A^T \mathbf y^*\) for some vector \(\mathbf y^*\ge 0\) such that if \((A\mathbf x^*)_k\lt b_k\) (inactive constraint) then \(y^*_k=0\text{.}\) Returning to <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-lp-duality-sketch.html" title="Equation 35.2.5">(35.2.5)</a> we see that with \(\mathbf y=\mathbf y^*\) it becomes an equality.</p>
