<p>The round-off errors made by a computer are usually very small: for example,</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3</pre>
<p data-braille="continuation">produces <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">5.5511e-17</code> instead of the expected <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">0</code>. The underlying reason is that, for example, the number \(0.1\) is internally represented not as \(1/10\) but as a fraction \(p/q\) where \(q\) must be a power of 2 (because the computer arithmetic is binary in nature. Both \(p\) and \(q\) are chosen very large which makes the approximation \(p/q \approx  1/10\) very good for most purposes. But it cannot be perfect, because if \(p/q = 1/10\text{,}\) then \(10p = q\) which is a contradiction: the left hand side is divisible by 5, so the right hand side cannot be a power of 2.</p>
