<p>The above code fails, as is often the case with multivariable optimization. We should think of a better way to choose the initial point. For example, the first parameter \(M\) is the carrying capacity, and this is clearly at least as large as 120. The second parameter is the \(x\)-coordinate of its center which looks like 10. And the third parameter is about a tenth of the horizontal span of the non-flat part, maybe 2. An initial point like <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[120; 10; 2]</code> does the job. Note that the fit is much better than what we achieved in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-best-fit-logistic.html" title="Example 28.2.1: Fit a logistic function to Covid data">ExampleÂ 28.2.1</a>.</p>
