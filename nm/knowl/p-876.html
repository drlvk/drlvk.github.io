<p>In practice, trying to minimize a function by solving <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-critical-points-eq.html" title="Equation 29.1.4">(29.1.4)</a> is not the most productive approach: there are probably many critical points, some of them saddle points, and some of them may be points of local maximum rather than minimum. It is better to search for a minimum directly, which is a problem of <dfn class="terminology">multivariable optimization</dfn>. We will study optimization in the last part of this course. For now, we'll use the built-in Matlab tool <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">fminsearch</code>, the underlying principle of which (the Nelder-Mead method) will be considered later.</p>
