<p>The tiny round-off errors have a major impact on the solution of linear systems when, as a result of some row operations, some entry should theoretically be zero but in practice it is not (like \(0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3\) above). So, the process of elimination that was supposed to eliminate a redundant equation, making it \(0=0\text{,}\) instead turns it into some “numerical garbage”. Matlab tries to detect such situations and warn the user about them, indicating that the solution it finds may be useless.</p>
