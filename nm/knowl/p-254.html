<p>The main limitation of the bisection method are:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>It does not apply to systems of more than one equation</li>
<li>It  requires the knowledge of a bracketing interval</li>
<li>It requires a continuous function</li>
<li>Its speed of convergence is slow (linear)</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">To illustrate the second limitation, consider the equation \(x^2 - 2x + 0.9999 = 0\text{.}\) It has two roots, both of which are very close to 1. Outside of a small neighborhood of 1, the function is positive. So, in order to construct a bracketing interval one needs to place one of its endpoints very close to 1. This means one needs to have a good idea of where the roots are in order to start with the method.</p>
