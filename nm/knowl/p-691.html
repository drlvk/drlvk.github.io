<p>There are infinitely many ways to connect given data points. The function <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-pl-interpolant.html" title="Equation 23.1.1">(23.1.1)</a> does so by a curve of minimal length, meaning that the graph of \(S\) is the shortest curve passing through the given data points. This is a reasonable way of connecting the points, but not necessarily the best or most natural way. The corners at the data points do not look natural. The piecewise linear graph does not give much insight into the rate of change of the function because it treats the rate as constant on each interval. For example, given the function values</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">
x = 1:5;
y = [8 5.5 5.3333 5.75 6.4];
</pre>
<p data-braille="continuation">what is the derivative of the function at \(x = 2\text{?}\) Differentiating the piecewise linear interpolant gives some information but not much. Another question one might ask is: where is the minimum of this function?  The minimum of piecewise linear interpolant is exactly at \(x=3\) but we understand the actual function probably has its minimum between \(2\) and \(3\text{.}\)</p>
