<p>Thus, the rate of new infections is \(\beta SI\) where \(\beta\) is the coefficient of proportionality that depends on how contagious the disease is and what preventive measures are taken by the population. At the same time, the rate of new recoveries can be reasonably assumed to be \(\gamma I\text{,}\) proportional to the number of currently infected. So we have the system</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align}
S' \amp = - \beta SI\tag{20.1.1}\\
I' \amp = \beta SI - \gamma I\tag{20.1.2}\\
R' \amp = \gamma I\tag{20.1.3}
\end{align}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">with some initial conditions \((S_0, I_0, R_0)\) where typically \(R_0=0\) and \(I_0\) is small. The constants \(\beta,\gamma\) are the <dfn class="terminology">parameters</dfn> of this system. Their values have a major impact on the long-term behavior of solutions; yet these values are very difficult to estimate in practice (especially \(\beta\)). One might try to estimate them by studying a small-scale outbreak closely and fitting a model to the observed counts of infected and recovered people.</p>
