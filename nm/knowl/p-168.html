<p>An array operation is not always faster than a loop. Operating with large arrays requires more memory to store intermediate results. Other internal implementation details may cause a loop with a scalar operation to be faster than an array operation. Thus, we usually cannot tell which approach is faster without measuring the computation time. For more examples, try different ways of computing the sums \(\sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{j}\) and \(\sum_{j=1}^n j^3\) where \(n=10^7\) as before. Also note that \(j^3\) could be computed as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">j*j*j</code>: does this speed up the computation?</p>
