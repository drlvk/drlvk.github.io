<p>A basic model of epidemic divides the population into three groups: susceptible \(S\) (able to be infected), infected \(I\text{,}\) and removed \(R\) (not able to be infected). Often group \(R\) is called “recovered” but it also contains deceased and vaccinated. One can modify the model in various ways: include a separate group for deceased, allow for a possibility of reinfection, etc. The sum \(S+I+R\) remains constant in time, because other demographic factors such as births do not substantially change the picture of an epidemic.</p>
